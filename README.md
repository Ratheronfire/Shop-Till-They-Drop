# Shop-Till-They-Drop
A game for the Ludum Dare 32 game jam, with the theme "an unconventional weapon."  Made using Construct 2.

Since making this game, I've started remaking it in Unity.  The new version is closed-source for the time being, but you can play it and follow my progress on its [GameJolt page](http://gamejolt.com/games/shop-till-they-drop/61696).
